# GNAT
GNAT is a web hosted pomodoro (and more) timer. The name GNAT is simultaneously a recursive acronym for "GNAT's Not Any Timer", and a contraction of the Danish word for _goodnight_. 

Hosted at: [drasbeck.dk/gnat](https://drasbeck.dk/gnat/gnat.html "GNAT")

Built with HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3.

Feel free to fork n' stuff =)

## Usage
* Create a custom timer, by selecting duration with the drop down menus.
* Use preset timers, by pressing the corresponding buttons.
  * Hotkeys
    * J: 25m
    * K: 5m
    * L: 20m
    * H: Toggle 'pause timer'/'resume timer'/'stop alarm'

## Known bugs
* cmd/alt + tabbing away from GNAT will in some cases cause GNAT to become unresponsive to hotkey input. Pressing a modifier key such as cmd or alt should resurrect hotkey functionality.
